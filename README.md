# stars-align

I'm so sorry for how unorganised this is!!

Went with a route of taking the raw data and creating an array of objects with nested arrays representing the position and velocity for each star

Then using this position and velocity to make a function that moves the stars once

I then wanted to have a while loop to invoke moveStars until the width of the full display grid is at a smaller size to determine when the stars are more closely aligned

I was also thinking of checking each position to see if there's another star adjacent. Then when most of the stars have adjacent ones, create the display grid and print this to a file to read
